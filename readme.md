# Dynamic Contact List #
### Instructions ###
- `cd` to the desired root directory of the project and run `git clone https://github.com/AndrewKiri/react-contacts.git`
- Make sure you have _NodeJS_ and _npm_ installed on your machine (usually the installation is combined for both)
- `cd` to the cloned directory and run `npm install` (this will install all dependencies that are required to use the app)
- Make sure you have `gulp` and `webpack` installed globally (if not, run the command `npm install gulp webpack -g`, prepend `sudo` if you're on Linux distro)
- Run `gulp` in the terminal, this will make webpack generate _javascript bundle_ and serve the site via browserSync's WebSocket connection
